============

My first OS X app written in Objective-C. Made during the summer of 2013 for OS X 10.8. No longer supported. 

Was my first app to ever be in an Apple top downloaded chart, reaching the #1 free finance app spot in 23 countries, making the top ten in 89 countries, and even making it into the top ten overall in one country.
